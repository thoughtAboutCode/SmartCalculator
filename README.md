# SmartCalculator
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), I learnt a lot about lists, strings, and other data types. 
You also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue; I alsolearnt about algorithm to convert 
infix expression to postfix expression.
